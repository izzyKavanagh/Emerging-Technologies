This project explores the classical and quantum solutions to the Deutsch and Deutsch–Jozsa problems using Python and Qiskit.

* Problem 1 implements a generator for random four-bit Boolean functions that are guaranteed to be either constant or balanced. 

* Problem 2 analyzes such functions classically and determines their type, highlighting the classical query cost.

* Problems 3 and 4 implement Deutsch’s algorithm for single-bit functions using Qiskit quantum oracles and circuits.

* Problem 5 scales this approach to the four-bit Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, demonstrating how quantum interference determines whether a function is constant or balanced with a single oracle query.
