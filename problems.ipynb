    "\n",
    "**Brief:** The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm is designed to work with functions that accept a fixed number of Boolean inputs and return a single Boolean output. Each function is guaranteed to be either constant (always returns False or always returns True) or balanced (returns True for exactly half of the possible input combinations). Write a Python function random_constant_balanced that returns a randomly chosen function from the set of constant or balanced functions taking four Boolean arguments as inputs."

    "**Brief:** Deutsch's algorithm is designed to demonstrate a potential advantage of quantum computing over classical computation. To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function determine_constant_balanced that takes as input a function f, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze f and return the string \"constant\" or \"balanced\" depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call f to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?"
